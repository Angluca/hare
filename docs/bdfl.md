# A note from Hare's BDFL

Hi! My name is Drew DeVault. I am the original author and designer of the Hare
programming language, and, with the mandate of the Hare community, I am the
project's benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).

The Hare project has grown a lot since I started working on it, and today there
are many talented people who work on the project at all levels, including those
coding in the trenches, in leadership positions, setting cultural norms, and
maintaining various subsystems or co-maintaining the project as a whole. For the
most part, the project runs smoothly thanks to their efforts and does not
require me to tread on too many toes.

In my role as the BDFL, I aim to offer the project a number of helpful
resources, such as:

- Overseeing the fiduciary responsibilities of the project
- Setting (and clarifying) the broader vision and direction for the project
- Organizing participants and empowering them to roles for which they are suited
- Planning long-term priorities and design goals
- Mediating conflicts in the community
- Providing the last word when consensus cannot be reached

I also have the burden of doing the nasty work when necessary: if required I may
exercise my power to remove difficult parties from the community, revoke
permissions of participants if necessary, or put my foot down on a proposal that
does not align with the project vision.

I am endowed with the last word, but I aim not to use it when it can be avoided.
I am a very busy person, and the project's scope exceeds my ability to manage it
alone. As such, it delights me when the community steps up to take on
responsibilities at every level. I try not to impose my will on the project too
much -- it's better if my role as the BDFL is a tool that the community chooses
to use when necessary.

If my resources are required to see something through, I have some specific
appeals regarding how community members can best utilize my attention. I cannot
keep up with most of the IRC discussions and a substantial fraction of the
mailing lists, but I will endeavour to participate when my presence is directly
requested.

If you require simple admin tasks, that only I am able to perform (e.g. spending
money on something, updating harelang.org DNS, managing contributor permissions
on SourceHut, etc), send me an email directly (sir@cmpwn.com) and I'll try to
get it done within a day or two.

Otherwise, you can get my attention on a discussion by Cc'ing me directly on an
email or mentioning my name (ddevault) on IRC.\* You can also reach out to me
privately via email or IRC if you have something specific to discuss or request.
The latency on such requests may be annoying, but please be patient and I will
strive to answer in the timeliest manner possible.

\* If you mention me on IRC please include a small summary of what you need in
the same message as my handle, so that I can still grasp the situation if I am
away from IRC for a few hours and the backlog fills up.

That's all! Thanks for participating in the Hare community, and thanks for your
trust. Have fun out there!
