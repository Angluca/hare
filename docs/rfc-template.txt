                              RFC SUMMARY

Free-form brief summary of the RFC's goals, 1-2 paragraphs in length.

                         LANGUAGE IMPLICATIONS

Enumerate proposed language changes in this section, if any.

Put "None" here if there are no language implications.

                     STANDARD LIBRARY IMPLICATIONS

Enumerate proposed standard library changes in this section, if any.
Focus on breaking changes to the standard library's API over
implementation details, unless implementation details are particularly
important.

Put "None" here if there are no standard library implications.

                         ECOSYSTEM IMPLICATIONS

Include considerations for the broader Hare ecosystem here, such as a
survey estimating how many third-party codebases will be affected and
how difficult it will be to implement the changes. If necessary, make a
plan for alleviating the impact, such as automated migration tools (e.g.
a sed script, or a dedicated tool for more complex migrations).

Put "None" here if there are no ecosystem implications (though in this
case, why is there an RFC for it?).

                              EXAMPLE CODE

Include in this section samples of example code as it will appear under
this RFC's proposed changes. This section is mandatory.

                              RELATED RFCS

Include a link to relevant RFCs (such as the prior version) on the
hare-rfc web archives, as well as a brief summary of changes from that
version or the reason why this RFC is relevant.

Put "None" here if there are no relevant RFCs.
